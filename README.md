How to use: (work in progress) :movie_camera:	


## What is the project ?

Basically we have created a **website** that display **movies** and **series** for people to watch. As you may have noticed we took inspiration of other existing plateforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney, Porcorn Time, Stremio etc. The main difference with our platform is the fact that we are specialized in science-fiction movies and series. :flying_saucer:


## The Mission

Our coaches gave us a new great challenge : create from scratch a streaming website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. The goal is to use all of our knowledge to create something with value in group. Let say that the project our first reaction to the challenge was being surprised. How are we going to make it ? Well, see you all in 12 days to see how it went.

As you surely have read, we have 12 days to set up everything in group of four.
